    <h1>Waste Not Cake</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This cake uses sour milk that would otherwise be thrown out. You'd never
      know it, though! It's moist, delicious, and easy to make.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>

        baking dish.

      <li>
        Cream sugar and butter together in a large bowl. Beat in eggs, cocoa
        powder, cinnamon, and cloves. Add flour alternately with soured milk,
        stirring batter until smooth. Fold in raisins. Dissolve baking soda in
        boiling water and add to the batter. Pour batter into the prepared

        Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted into the center comes
