    <h1>Easy Yogurt Cake</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is an easy yogurt cake that uses the yogurt container to measure all
      of the ingredients. It's ready in under an hour and the perfect
      not-too-sweet snack or breakfast treat. It's known in France as "Gâteau au
      Yaourt" and is typically the first cake that French children learn how to
      make. My son attends a French school and has made this with his
      classmates.

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round
        springform cake pan.

        Empty the yogurt into a mixing bowl. Measure the oil, using the yogurt
        container, and add to the yogurt. Set aside. Rinse yogurt container and
        dry with paper towel to continue using it as a measuring tool.

        Add eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract to the yogurt-oil mixture. Beat
        well until thoroughly combined. Add flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir
        until just combined; batter will be thick. Pour into the prepared cake
        pan and spread to level the top.
